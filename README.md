# BlockDude
[CS 120B] Intro to Embedded Systems Project

This is an implementation of the game Block Dude (from the TI graphing
calculator) on a breadboard.  The goal of the puzzle is to get to the 
door located at the furthest right top light of the LED matrix. The 
player, Block Dude, can carry red blocks to make steps to reach high 
places.
